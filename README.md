## Introduction 
The main dataset contains data on events for the mobile game Space Brothers. Players have to create their own space programs and try to colonize the galaxy.

The basic monetization of the game is still in the planning stages. It's expected that the app will show ads on the screen where the user selects the type of objects to be constructed.

The dataset contains data on users in the first stage of the game. To reach the second stage, they need to do one of the following:

Defeat the first boss
Build an orbital satellite-assembly system


## Goal 
You have to create a monetization model for a game app.

Carry out exploratory data analysis
Analyze the impact of events on the target event
Test statistical hypotheses:
Test a hypothesis on the difference in completion time between users who:
Finish the stage by building the assembly
Those who do so by beating the boss.
Formulate a statistical hypothesis regarding the data from the dataset and test it

## Data description 
The dataset contains data on the first users of the app â€” the cohort of users who began playing the game between May 4 and 10, inclusive.
